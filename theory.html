            <strong>Define internet backbone in your own words:</strong>
            <p>The internet backbone refers to the principal data routes between large, strategically interconnected networks and core routers on the internet.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>What is the difference between clients and servers on the internet?</strong>
            <p>Clients request resources or services, while servers provide those resources or services. For example, a web browser is a client, and a web server hosts the requested webpage.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Draw or describe how servers, routers, switches, workstations, and other hardware components are part of the internet:</strong>
            <p>The internet consists of interconnected devices: workstations (end-user devices) connect to switches, which direct traffic within a local network. Routers link different networks together, and servers host data and applications that clients access.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Describe the Internet Protocol Suite (TCP/IP) model of networking, outlining how this protocol provides the data transfer mechanism required to establish client/server relationships:</strong>
            <p>The TCP/IP model includes four layers (Application, Transport, Internet, and Network Access) that work together to transmit data. TCP ensures reliable delivery, while IP handles addressing and routing.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>List at least three examples of internet services that rely on client/server relationships:</strong>
            <p>Examples include email (SMTP, IMAP, POP), the World Wide Web (HTTP/HTTPS), and file sharing (FTP).</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>What is hypertext?</strong>
            <p>Hypertext refers to text that contains links to other texts or media, enabling non-linear navigation through digital content.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>How is "the web" related to the internet?</strong>
            <p>The web is a service that runs on the internet, consisting of interconnected documents and resources accessed via web browsers using HTTP/HTTPS protocols.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Explain how the Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) is used to facilitate client/server interaction:</strong>
            <p>HTTP is a protocol that allows a client (e.g., a web browser) to request resources from a server (e.g., a web server). The server responds with the requested data or an error message.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>What is HTTP and how is it different from HTTPS?</strong>
            <p>HTTP is the standard protocol for transferring web data, while HTTPS adds encryption (via SSL/TLS) to ensure secure communication.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Describe and illustrate the development of the Web in general terms using the Web 1.0, Web 2.0, and Web 3.0 generational paradigms:</strong>
            <p>Web 1.0: Static, read-only content. Web 2.0: Dynamic, user-generated content and interaction (social media, blogs). Web 3.0: Decentralized, semantic web with AI and blockchain integration.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Compare and contrast the Web 1.0, Web 2.0, and Web 3.0 stages of development:</strong>
            <p>Web 1.0 focused on static content, Web 2.0 emphasized interactivity and collaboration, and Web 3.0 aims for decentralization and intelligent data.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Describe the role markup languages play in the Web:</strong>
            <p>Markup languages structure and format content on the web, enabling browsers to render and display data correctly (e.g., HTML).</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Compare and contrast markup and scripting languages:</strong>
            <p>Markup languages define structure and presentation (e.g., HTML, XML), while scripting languages add interactivity and functionality (e.g., JavaScript).</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Explain the relationship between Standard Generalized Markup Language (SGML), Extensible Markup Language (XML), Hypertext Markup Language (HTML), Extensible Hypertext Markup Language (XHTML), Dynamic Hypertext Markup Language (DHTML), and markdown (MD):</strong>
            <p>SGML is a standard for defining markup languages. XML is a simplified subset of SGML. HTML and XHTML are specific implementations for web content. DHTML adds interactivity with scripts and styles. Markdown is a lightweight markup language for simple formatting.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>List some of your own interests, values, beliefs, resources, prior learning, and experiences:</strong>
            <p>Reflect on your personal and academic background, highlighting relevant skills and knowledge.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Describe how CSE1210 may connect to your future occupational choices:</strong>
            <p>Consider how the topics covered in CSE1210 align with your career goals in technology, networking, or related fields.</p>
